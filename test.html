    <p>We built Supportable out of necessity. After 30+ years of experience providing services to individuals in the
        Mental Health, Behavioral Health, Human Services, and Substance Use industry, we kept searching for but never
        found a solution to help us truly organize our intake operations.</p>
    <p>Supportable is an all-in-one intake software designed with a simple design for intuitive use. Our software hosts
        many&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a

        verification, pre-screening questionnaires, and custom checklists. You can manage client progress through our
        all-encompassing, customizable process to reduce your
        workload.</p>
